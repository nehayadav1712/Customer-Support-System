# Customer-Support-System
This Python based Customer Support System leverages the power of BERT for sentiment prediction and LSTM for model building. With a final training accuracy of 90.62% and a validation accuracy of 85.66%, the system excels in discerning the sentiments expressed in customer support interactions.

Overview
This project implements a Customer Support Sentiment Analysis System using Python, BERT, and LSTM. The system is designed to analyze customer reviews and predict sentimentâ€”whether positive, negative, or neutral.

Features
Sentiment Prediction: BERT is employed for accurate sentiment prediction.
Model Architecture: LSTM networks are used for effective model building.
Visualizations: The project includes visualizations to enhance understanding.

How it Works:
The system addresses the challenge of understanding customer sentiments in support interactions. The model is trained on a dataset of customer reviews, learning to classify them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The problem statement revolves around enhancing customer support by automating the sentiment analysis process.

Solution:
BERT for Contextual Understanding: BERT excels at capturing contextual nuances in language, allowing the model to understand the intricacies of customer messages.
LSTM for Sequential Patterns: Long Short-Term Memory networks are employed to capture sequential patterns in the data, crucial for interpreting the flow of conversations and understanding sentiment evolution.
Accuracy Metrics: The model achieves a final training accuracy of 90.62% and a validation accuracy of 85.66%, showcasing its proficiency in sentiment classification.

How it Works
The model is trained on a dataset of customer reviews and product information, learning to classify sentiments. BERT provides contextual understanding, while LSTM captures sequential patterns for robust sentiment analysis.

Results
Final Training Accuracy: 90.62%
Final Validation Accuracy: 85.66%
